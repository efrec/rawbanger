Util script for modding Dwarf Fortress with an example mod built in.

This was just a collection of shell commands I'd been running to get mods patched together. It became a little long, so it went in a few files, then became one file, and then became too homogeneous to separate the data and code, and now it's here.

The mod in question is "bugspilled", ambiguously "bugs that are pilled" and "spilled by a bug", I guess. It does a lot of work that would be sanity-draining to write out by hand or keep updated between DF versions.
